# Todo List App

Work from your Lab 2 code. Implement the same todo list functionality from Lab 1, but using React instead of a CLI.

Your app should support:
- Adding multiple todos
- Listing all todos
- Editing any todo by ID
- Deleting any todo by ID

Reference Lab 1's logic and adapt it to work with React components and state management.

Lab 3 == Lab 1 but with React == Lab 2 but with multiple todos
